Love Open Source? So do we!

This project is a test! What can we do with it. What can we do together?

We'd love to see your project suggestions listed here. We want to get everyone involved in the process of suggesting, selecting, developing and creating great open source solutions.

### Get Started

For *theincubatorâ„¢*, we're using the issues mechanism in github for discussing project ideas. Head [*over there*](https://github.com/swopensource/theincubator/issues) to read project ideas submitted by others and join the conversation or suggest a project idea of your own that you'd like to see created. No suggestion or comment is out of bounds. **Go on, don't be shy** :)
